'NPCs' are placed into a something x something grid.
They move around to find other NPCs and when they are in their view radius they attack them
depending on the amount of strength an npc have the higher chance they will have to win a fight 
you can change almost everything ranging from grid size to winner strength gain divisor
this is my biggest project (but still small) so far, so dont have high expectations
